The title, \"geocentric models,\" refers to models that make good predictions, but do not provide causal information about a question. One of these examples is linear regression. This chapter gives examples of basic bayesian linear regression and includes details such as prior predictive checks and how to fit curves with polynomials and b-splines.\n\n## Chapter notes\n\n* Normal distributions arise from sums of random fluctuations. Lognormal distributions arise from products of random fluctuations. This property explains why normal distributions are so good at modeling real world data (ontological justification).\n* Normal distributions can also be justified by the principle of maximum entropy -- if all we are willing to specify about a distribution is its mean and variance, then the normal distribution contains the least amount of information (epistemological justification).\n* Index coding (as opposed to dummy coding or similar methods) makes specification of priors for categorical variables easier.\n* The **prior predictive simulation**, drawing samples from the distribution implied by the priors, is essential for ensuring that our priors are reasonable. Note that we should not compare the prior predictive simulation to the observed data, only to our preexisting knowledge of constraints on the model.\n* Many models which are written in the \"plus epsilon\" form (see pg 81) (typical for linear models) can be rewritten in this more general framework, which will be easier for non-Gaussian models.\n* **Quadratic approximation**, estimating the peak of the posterior distribution with a multivariate normal distribution, is easier than grid approximation and works well when the posterior is approximately Gaussian (many simple examples are). The peak of the quadratic approximate posterior is the *maximum a posteriori* estimate.\n* Recall that even though grid and quadratic approximate posteriors provide an actual estimate of the posterior distribution, we can (and should) still sample from the posterior. This mimics the process for inference on more complicated models that must be fit with MCMC algorithms.\n* A **linear model** fits the mean, $\\mu$, of an outcome as a linear function of the predictor variable(s) and some parameters. These models are often *geocentric* -- they provide good answers, but often say nothing about causality.\n* Plotting simulations of the posterior distribution can provide a lot of information about the posterior (see pg 99), often much more than tables of calculations alone.\n* These types of Bayesian models incorporate two different types of uncertainty -- uncertainty in parameter values, which is based on the plausibility of parameter values after seeing the data, and uncertainty from sampling processes.\n* We can extend linear models to fit curved patterns in datas in several ways, but two of the easiest are polynomials and b-splines. Priors can be difficult to fit to both, as these models are also geocentric. They can accurately fit curves, but do not describe the mechanism or process that generates curved data in the first place. See pg. 119 for an example of fitting a b-spline model using `rethinking`. One further extension is the generalized additive model (GAM) which incorporates smoothing over continuous predictor variables.\n\n## Exercises\n\nThe first few questions are about the following model.\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 10) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(1)\n\\end{align*}\n\n### 4E1\nIn the model shown, the line $y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma)$ is the likelihood.\n\n### 4E2\nThe model contains two parameters ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$).\n\n### 4E3\nTo use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior, we would write\n$$\n\\frac{\\prod_{i} \\mathrm{Normal}(y_i \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) \\times \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu \\mid 0, 10) \\times \\mathrm{Exponential}(\\sigma \\mid 1)}{\\int\\int \\prod_{i} \\mathrm{Normal}(y_i \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) \\times \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu \\mid 0, 10) \\times \\mathrm{Exponential}(\\sigma \\mid 1) \\ \\mathrm{d}\\mu \\ \\mathrm{d}\\sigma}.\n$$\n\n### 4E4\nIn the model shown below, the linear model is the line $\\mu_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i$.\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\alpha + \\beta x_i \\\\\n\\alpha &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 10) \\\\\n\\beta &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 1) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(2)\n\\end{align*}\n\n### 4E5\nThere are three parameters in the posterior distribution of the model shown ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\sigma$) -- $\\mu$ is no longer a parameter of the model since it is calculated deterministically.\n\n### 4M1\nFor the model definition below, simulate observed $y$ values from the prior.\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 10) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(1)\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Do the simulation\nmu <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 10)\nsigma <- rexp(1000, rate = 1)\ny <- rnorm(1000, mu, sigma)\n\n# Plot the results\nlayout(matrix(c(1, 2, 3), ncol = 3))\nhist(y, breaks = \"FD\", main = \"y\")\nhist(mu, breaks = \"FD\", main = \"mu\")\nhist(sigma, breaks = \"FD\", main = \"sigma\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cp4_files/figure-html/4M1-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4M2\nTranslate the model into a `quap` formula.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),\nmu ~ dnorm(0, 10),\nsigma ~ dexp(1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 4M3\nTranslate the `quap` model formula below into a mathematical model definition.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),\nmu <- a + b * x,\na ~ dnorm(0, 10),\nb ~ dunif(0, 1),\nsigma ~ dexp(1)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= a + b * x_i \\\\\na &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(0, 10) \\\\\nb &\\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(0, 1) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(1)\n\\end{align*}\n\n### 4M4\nA sample of students is measured for height each year for 3 years. After the third year, you want to fit a linear regression predicting height using year as a predictor. Write down the mathematical model, defending any priors you choose.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\alpha + \\beta * (\\mathrm{year}_i - \\min \\mathrm{year}_i) \\\\\n\\alpha &\\sim \\mathrm{Normal}(120, 30) \\\\\n\\beta &\\sim \\mathrm{Log-Normal}(0, 1.5) \\\\\n\\sigma &\\sim \\mathrm{Exponential}(0, 0.2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo create the priors, I assumed that height was measured in centimeters. If it is not, transforming either the data or the prior coefficients is a simple linear transformation. The prior for the intercept is centered at a relatively small height (around four feet) with a large spread to allow for differences in biological sex or age distributions in the population, since these were not specified in the question. I subtracted the minimum year in the model so that the years would be scaled as 0, 1, 2, 3, instead of the actual numeric value of the year.\n\nIn general, we know that height increases over time, so I used a lognormal prior for the slope to enforce a positivity constraint. The prior has a location parameter of 0, allowing for the chance of no growth over the three years, but a wide spread was chosen by experimenting until the prior predictive simulation represented a wide range of possible trajectories with very few trajectories appearing to be biologically unreasonable. Again, the value was chosen by experimenting with prior predictive simulations until the result appeared to capture a large variety of biologically meaningful trajectories.\n\nI assigned an exponential prior to sigma to reflect the fact that all variances are positive, and most tend to be small-ish, but can be large. I had a difficult time with this one in particular because this model structure seems to imply that people can shrink in-between years. This would be possible with measurement error, but I think it would be quite difficult to have measurement error this severe in something like height, which is easy to measure. However, in order to include a constraint that height can only increase, I think we would need to change the likelihood in the model, which we haven't discussed yet in the book, so I didn't want to worry about that. (For example, we could make height lognormally distributed, so random fluctuations would only increase height, as opposed to the current model where random fluctuations can decrease height.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(100)\n\n# Prior predictive simulation\na <- rnorm(1000, 120, 30)\nb <- rlnorm(1000, 0, 1.5)\n\n# PPS for mu -- only needs a and b\nlayout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1))\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = c(-0.05, 3.05),\n\tylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = c(\"year\"),\n\tylab = c(\"height\"),\n\tmain = \"prior predictive simulation of mu\"\n)\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n\tcurve(a[i] + b[i] * x, from = 0, to = 3, add = TRUE,\n\t\t  col = rethinking::col.alpha(\"black\", 0.1))\n}\n\n# PPS for y -- for each a, b, simulate variance around the sampled mu.\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = c(-0.05, 3.05),\n\tylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = c(\"year\"),\n\tylab = c(\"height\"),\n\tmain = \"prior predictive simulation of y\"\n)\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nsigma <- rexp(1000, 1 / 5)\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n\tlines(x = 0:3, y = rnorm(4, a[i] + b[i] * 0:3, sigma[i]),\n\t\t  col = rethinking::col.alpha(\"black\", 0.1))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cp4_files/figure-html/4M4-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4M5\nIf I were reminded that every student got taller each year, this would not really change my choice of priors, but it does make me consider the same issues. I already accounted for this in the prior for $\\beta$. However, it does make me think more about the likelihood I used -- I really dislike that this likelihood allows for fluctuations that show up like this. Height is not measured perfectly, but large variations are uncommon. So perhaps it makes more sense to have quite a small variance parameter ($\\sigma$). Or perhaps we could structure the model so that each student has a common variance parameter that does not change every year. We could also consider making the effect of $\\beta$ stronger, so that there is an assumed growth effect and not growing each year is more rare. So perhaps we could consider the following adjusted priors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(100)\n\n# Prior predictive simulation\na <- rnorm(1000, 120, 30)\nb <- rlnorm(1000, 2, 0.5)\n\n# PPS for mu -- only needs a and b\nlayout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1))\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = c(-0.05, 3.05),\n\tylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = c(\"year\"),\n\tylab = c(\"height\"),\n\tmain = \"prior predictive simulation of mu\"\n)\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n\tcurve(a[i] + b[i] * x, from = 0, to = 3, add = TRUE,\n\t\t  col = rethinking::col.alpha(\"black\", 0.1))\n}\n\n# PPS for y -- for each a, b, simulate variance around the sampled mu.\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = c(-0.05, 3.05),\n\tylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = c(\"year\"),\n\tylab = c(\"height\"),\n\tmain = \"prior predictive simulation of y\"\n)\nabline(h = 0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nsigma <- rexp(1000, 1)\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n\tlines(x = 0:3, y = rnorm(4, a[i] + b[i] * 0:3, sigma[i]),\n\t\t  col = rethinking::col.alpha(\"black\", 0.1))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cp4_files/figure-html/4M5-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese priors still represent a wide range of biologically accurate values, but there is much less internal (within-subject) fluctuation in height between years, and on average, the slope is steeper.\n\n### 4M6\nIf I had the information that variance among heights for students of the same age is never more than 64cm, this would change my choice of variance prior (assuming that this is *a priori* information and not measured from our sample).

The number of knots and the prior for the weights controls the \"wiggliness\" (the smoothness or penalty) of the splines. More knots or a wider prior allows for more local variation in the spline curve, whereas constraining the number of knots (or shrinking the weights toward 0) constrains the spline, forcing it to vary less. I guess that the prior on the weights here is equivalent to increasing the penalty term of some other kind of spline, and a higher number of knots allows for a higher degree of interpolation as more inflection points are included.\n\n### 4H1\nWe want to estimate the expected heights of the 5 individuals from the !Kung census with weights given in the text.

There seems to be an inflection point around a weight of 30 where the trend is no longer linear, which will make the entire model fit worse (particularly because this region has high leverage). There is also some curvature in the lower weight values as well. Perhaps it would be better to fit this model with a spline or with a dummy variable for \"age categories\" that interacts with the slope term, allowing the model to \"bend\" at particular points -- the same thing could be accomplished using splines with degree 1. Normally I hate discretization, but in this case these trends are likely to map to our approximate knowledge of human growth. Babies grow faster than toddlers, and teenagers grow faster than younger children. So perhaps including more information in our model could help solve this problem as well. But if we don't want to include age, a spline could probably work better.\n\n### 4H3\nBased on our colleague's suggestion, we want to use the natural logarithm of weight to model height.

But since we have a parabola now, we don't need to constrain the linear part to be positive -- we could get an always positive derivative even with a negative linear term ($2ax + b > 0$ for $ax^2 + bx + c$, so e.g. if $a = 2, \\ b = -2$ the derivative will be positive for all $x > 1$, and all of our values are larger than 30). So I changed the priors to get trajectories that cover a bit more of the reasonable space. They approach the edges in some cases, but that's okay. I wasn't really sure what else to do with this question once I saw that the parabolas were all already in the reasonable space.\n\nMaybe I was supposed to NOT standardize the data, even though the chapter did this and the book didn't explicitly say what model to use. However, assigning a biologically meaningful prior without even centering the data is quite difficult, because in this example it makes sense to constrain the (non-centered) intercept at 0 (i.e. a person with weight zero has height zero).\n\nHowever, we can quickly see how this model doesn't make biological sense by thinking about where we should center the data. If we center at the mean, our parabola has to be either concave up or concave down (recall the second derivative of a parabola is constant), which doesn't make any sense. Why would low weight people be taller, or high weight people be shorter? By centering the data at the mean we force the parabola to take one of these two options. So perhaps standardizing by some reference point would be good, but remember that we don't want to look at the data to choose where to standardize. So we're forced to make one of two biologically inaccurate assumptions: either the concavity must be unreasonable or the intercept must be unreasonable. So let's set an unreasonable intercept and choose not to center the data. That way we can at least constrain the concavity to be positive.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Setup\nset.seed(100)\nlayout(matrix(c(1, 2), ncol = 2))\n\n# Repeat the original priors listed\na <- rnorm(N, 178, 20)\nb1 <- rlnorm(N, 0, 1)\nb2 <- rnorm(N, 0, 1)\n\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = range(d2$weight), ylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = \"weight\", ylab = \"height\",\n\tmain = \"Original priors\"\n)\nabline(h =   0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n\tcurve(\n\t\ta[i] + b1[i] * x + b2[i] * (x ^ 2),\n\t\tfrom = min(d2$weight), to = max(d2$weight),\n\t\tadd = TRUE,\n\t\tcol = col.alpha(\"black\", 0.2)\n\t)\n}\n\n# Repeat the original priors listed\na <- rnorm(N, 90, 20)\nb1 <- rnorm(N, 0, 0.5)\nb2 <- rnorm(N, 0.02, 0.005)\n\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = range(d2$weight), ylim = c(-100, 400),\n\txlab = \"weight\", ylab = \"height\",\n\tmain = \"New priors\"\n)\nabline(h =   0, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 272, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n\tcurve(\n\t\ta[i] + b1[i] * x + b2[i] * (x ^ 2),\n\t\tfrom = min(d2$weight), to = max(d2$weight),\n\t\tadd = TRUE,\n\t\tcol = col.alpha(\"black\", 0.2)\n\t)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cp4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere. Now our priors for the non-centered data fit inside the reasonable range. Are you happy now? They don't really make any sense (why would a person with 0 weight have 90 height? why do we have to restrain the coefficient for the b terms so much?) but they fit inside the line. I think the better answer for this question is to either standardize the data or avoid using a quadratic model for this problem, which was maybe the entire point of the question.\n\n### 4H5\nReturn to the cherry blossoms data and model the association between blossom date (`doy`) and March temperature (`temp`). Note that there are many missing values in both variables. You may consider a linear model, a polynomial, or a spline on temperature. How well does temperature trend predict the blossom trend?\n\nI'm leaning towards splines for this question -- I expect this relationship to be nonlinear, and given my frustration with polynomial models in the previous question, I think it's okay to stick with a spline. So first we need to set up the splines. We haven't talked about missing data at all yet in this book so I'll just use the complete cases.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"cherry_blossoms\")\nd <- cherry_blossoms[ , c(\"temp\", \"doy\")]\nd2 <- d[complete.cases(d), ]\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's do a prior predictive simulation. I'll start with the priors in the book for the previous model, but then adjust if they look unreasonable. I looked at the paper cited in the cherry blossoms data description, and it appears that the temperatures were measured in Kyoto. So I googled \"Kyoto march temperature\" and I guess we can assume that temperatures should be between 3 and 14 degrees celsius. McElreath says that the flowers can bloom any time from March to May, so as long as our predictions are between day 60 (first day of March in regular year) and day 152 (first day of May in leap year), I'll consider that to be \"reasonable\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 1000\nset.seed(100)\n\n# Create a range of temperature for the PPS splines\ntemp_range <- seq(2, 14, 0.05)\nnk <- 15\n\n# Create the splines\nB <-\n\tsplines::bs(\n\t\tx = temp_range,\n\t\tknots = quantile(temp_range, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = nk))[-c(1, nk)],\n\t\tdegree = 3,\n\t\tintercept = TRUE\n\t)\n\n# Simulate a since it is easy\na <- rnorm(N, 100, 10)\n\n# Simulate the weights with a little trickery\nw <- do.call(rbind, purrr::map(1:ncol(B), ~rnorm(N, 0, 15)))\n\n# Calculate the predicted means\nmu <- a + B %*% w\n\n# Plot the pps\nlayout(1)\nplot(\n\tNULL,\n\txlim = c(2, 14), ylim = c(40, 170),\n\txlab = \"temperature (Celsius)\", ylab = \"day of year\",\n\txaxs=\"i\", yaxs=\"i\"\n)\nabline(h =  60, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\nabline(h = 152, lty = 2, lwd = 0.5)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n\tlines(x = temp_range, y = mu[, i], col = col.alpha(\"black\", 0.05))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cp4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYeah, the default priors look pretty good to me. The only change I made was to increase the width of the prior for $w$, to potentially allow for more wiggliness. There is a bit of wiggling out of the expected day of year range, but it's so rare that I think it will be fine, especially after the model sees the data. I think it will be harder to set the correct prior on $w$ with a prior predictive simulation, so I think we better go ahead and fit the model.\n\nNow let's fit a `quap` model.

However, we would need more high-temperature data to confirm this trend (and high-temperature data is something we wish we didn't have more of, really).\n\n### 4H6\n\n**Q.** Simulate the prior predictive distirbution for the cherry blossom spline in the chapter. Adjust the prior on the weights and observe what happens. What do you think the prior on the weights is doing?\n\nOk, first we need to simulate the PPD. I'm pretty sure I already have a handle on this from the previous two spline exercises, but it should be fun. (In fact, we really already did this exact exercise, but whatever I guess.)\n\nLet's simulate with maybe six different widths: 1, 5, 10 (chosen in the textbook), 15, 20, and 50.

If we increase the width, the spline is encouraged to vary more, and will \"wiggle\" (spike up and down) with larger fluctuations. If we constrain this parameter, the spline is encouraged to vary less, staying closer to the intercept.\n\n### 4H8\n\n**Q.** The cherry blossom split in the chapter used an intercept $\\alpha$, but technically it doesn't require one. The first basis functions could substitute for the intercept. Try refitting the cherry blossom spline without the intercept. What else about the model do you need to change to make this work.\n\nThis question is worded a bit confusingly to me.
