# Week 1 Homework

This homework covers the material from Lectures 1 and 2, and the content from
book Chapters 1, 2, and 3.

**1.** Suppose the globe tossing data (Lecture 2, Chapter 2) had turned out to
be 4 water and 11 land. Construct the posterior distribution.

:::

Fortunately, I already did a very similar problem in the textbook, so I used
the function that I already wrote. This assumes a uniform prior distribution
for $p$.

```{r}
globe_post <- function(w, l) {
    # Define the grid of points to evaluate
    p_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
    
    # Uniform prior on p: f(x) = 1 / (1 - 0) = 1 for all p
    prior <- rep(1, times = length(p_grid))
    
    # Compute the likelihood over the grid given the observed sample
    likelihood <- dbinom(w, size = w + l, prob = p_grid)
    
    # Compute the unstandardized posterior
    unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior
    
    # Standardize the posterior
    posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)
    
    # Make the plot
    plot(p_grid, posterior, type = "b", xlab = "P(water)",
         ylab = "Posterior probability")
    mtext(paste(length(p_grid), "points:", w, "W,", l, "L"))
    
    # Invisibly return posterior density estimate
    invisible(posterior)
}
# Calculate the posterior after assuming there are 4 water observations and
# 11 land observations
post <- globe_post(w = 4, l = 11)
```

**2.** Using the posterior distribution from **1**, compute the posterior
predictive distribution for the next 5 tosses of the same globe. I recommend
you use the sampling method.

:::

First we construct a set of 10000 samples from the posterior distribution. We
sample from the same grid of $p$ values that we used to calculate the posterior
distribution, weighting the likelihood of each value by the calculated
posterior density.

```{r}
samples <- sample(
	x = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
	size = 1e5,
	prob = post,
	replace = TRUE
)
```

Next we compute the posterior predictive distribution. We draw from the
likelihood function (with $n = 5$ to represent the next five samples) using the
sampled values of $p$.

```{r}
post_pred <- rbinom(10000, size = 5, prob = samples)
rethinking::simplehist(post_pred)
```

**3.** Use the posterior predictive distribution from **2** to calculate the
probability of 3 or more water samples in the next 5 tosses.

:::

Now that we have the samples from the posterior predictive distribution, this
probability is simple to approximate.

```{r}
mean(post_pred >= 3)
```

The probability of three or more water samples in the next 5 tosses is
approximately $18.28\%$, based on our posterior predictive distribution.

**4.** Suppose you observe $W = 5$ water points, but you forgot to write down
how many times the globe was tossed, so you don't know the number of land
points, $L$. Assume that $p = 0.7$ and compute the posterior distribution of
the number of tosses $N$.

:::

If we assume that $p = 0.5$ and we observe $W = 5$ water points, then the
likelihood as a function of $N$ (unknown) is

$$P(N) = \left( N\atop{5} \right) 5^{0.7} (N-5)^{0.3}.$$

We need to choose a prior for $N$ in order to calculate the posterior
distribution. We haven't discussed many different distributions for priors yet,
but I'll choose a Poisson prior because it has the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, \infty\}$
as its support, so there is no upper limit on $N$ that we have to choose.
The Poisson distribution has one parameter, called $\lambda$, I'll choose to
be $5$ for no other reason than that is the number of throws we know we
observed. It would also make sense to choose a uniform prior with some very
large upper boundary, say $\mathrm{Uniform}(5, 100)$. (Or even smaller than
that, because we can probably place a relatively small upper bound on the
number of times we threw the ball, since we know $p = 0.7$.)

Other than changing the prior, we calculate this the same way. Since it's
impossible for us to evaluate every $N$ up to $\infty$, I'll just calculate
up to 25 and that should be plenty.

```{r}
# Define the grid of points to evaluate
n_grid <- seq(from = 0, to = 25, by = 1)
# Poisson prior on n
prior <- dpois(n_grid, lambda = 5)
# Compute the likelihood over the grid given the observed sample
likelihood <- dbinom(5, size = n_grid, prob = 0.7)
# Compute the unstandardized posterior
unstd.posterior <- likelihood * prior
# Standardize the posterior
posterior <- unstd.posterior / sum(unstd.posterior)
# Make the plot
plot(n_grid, posterior, type = "b", xlab = "Number of samples (N)",
		 ylab = "Posterior probability")
lines(n_grid, prior, type = "l", lty = 2)
```

In this figure, the points are the observed posterior probabilities. The solid
line just connects them to give us a better idea of the shape of the distribution.
The dashed line shows the Poisson prior on $N$.

As we can see in the posterior, **it is impossible that we drew less than 5**
**samples**. That's good, that means that our model reflects reality,
which is a good sanity check for our golem. Given that $p = 0.7$ however,
it is actually quite plausible that we only tossed the globe 5 times, which
could explain why we didn't write down the number of tosses or the number of
land throws -- there weren't any.

However, the MAP estimate would be that we threw the globe 6 times, with 7
times in a close second place. As we get to 10 or higher, it becomes
incredibly unlikely that we would throw the ball this many times and *only*
observe 5 water tosses.
