# Week 4 Homework

This homework covers the material from Lectures 7 and 8, and the content from
book Chapters 7, 8, and 9. The questions are reproduced almost identically from
[Richard McElreath's original assignment](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023/blob/main/homework/week04.pdf), I did not write them. I only wrote these solutions.

```{r setup}
library(rethinking)
```

**1.** Revisit the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from
Chapter 6. Run models `m6.9` and `m6.10` again (pages 178-179). Compare these
two models using both PSIS and WAIC. Which model is expected to make
better predictions, according to these criteria, and which model yields the
correct causal inference?

:::

OK, first we will fit the models. Since these are exactly the same as in the
book, the results will be similar and I won't spend a lot of time on them.

```{r q1 model fitting}
# Data setup
d <- sim_happiness(seed = 1977, N_years = 1000)
d2 <- d[d$age > 17, ]
d2$A <- (d2$age - 18) / (65 - 18)
d2$M <- d2$married + 1

set.seed(134123)

# First model: 
m6.9 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			happiness ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a[M] + bA * A,
			a[M] ~ dnorm(0, 1),
			bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = d2
	)

# Second model
m6.10 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			happiness ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + bA * A,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 1),
			bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = d2
	)
```

OK, now we want to score the models by PSIS and WAIC. Let's do PSIS first.

```{r}
PSIS(m6.9)
PSIS(m6.10)
```

And now the WAIC.

```{r}
WAIC(m6.9)
WAIC(m6.10)
```

OK, so for this model they are basically the same. But either way, we
see that model `m6.9`, which stratifies by marriage, is **better at**
**prediction**! However, we know that `m6.10` actually makes the correct
causal inference. This should not surprised us, because colliders contain
information -- even if they distort causal estimates, including them will
often work better for prediction.

**2.** Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week's homework. On the
basis of PSIS and WAIC scores, which combination of variables best predicts
body weight? What causal interpretation can you assign each coefficient
from the best scoring model?

:::

First I'll fit the two models that we were using at the end of last week's
homework -- the model for the direct effect of $F$ and the model for the
total effect of $F$ (which we recall that we could not accurately estimate
due to an unmeasured confounder). We'll also add an additional "kitchen sink"
model that includes age (even though it is a precision parasite), just
because we also have that. There are
seven different models that we could choose, but I think these three will
probably be sufficient.

```{r}
# Set up data
data(foxes)
D <-
	foxes |>
	dplyr::select(
		F = avgfood,
		A = area,
		W = weight,
		G = groupsize
	) |>
	dplyr::mutate(
		dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), standardize)
	) |>
	as.list()

# Fit the two models
set.seed(193482)
kitchen_sink <-
	rethinking::quap(
		flist = alist(
			W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + bF * F + bG * G + bA * A,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bG ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = D,
		control = list(maxit = 500)
	)
f_direct <-
	rethinking::quap(
		flist = alist(
			W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + bF * F + bG * G,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bG ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = D,
		control = list(maxit = 500)
	)
f_total <-
	rethinking::quap(
		flist = alist(
			W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + bF * F,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = D,
		control = list(maxit = 500)
	)

coeftab(kitchen_sink, f_direct, f_total) |>
	coeftab_plot(pars = c("bA", "bF", "bG"))
```

OK, now we can calculate the PSIS and WAIC for all of these.

```{r}
sapply(list(kitchen_sink, f_direct, f_total), PSIS) |>
	`colnames<-`(c("A, G, F", "F, G", "F"))

sapply(list(kitchen_sink, f_direct, f_total), WAIC) |>
	`colnames<-`(c("A, G, F", "F, G", "F"))
```

Here we get a little bit of a competition, but not much of one. We can see
that the "kitchen sink" model wins by less than a point for PSIS, but
the direct causal model wins by less than a point for WAIC. That's obviously
due to approximation error, it doesn't matter which one
wins by just a few points. Clearly we can see that the model for the direct
causal effect beats out the model for the total causal effect, which makes
sense because both of these variables encode unique information about the
outcome (from our causal model, $A$ does not).

For the best model, we can infer the *direct* causal effects of $F$ and $G$,
but not the *total* causal effect of $F$.

**3.** Build a predictive model of the relationship shown on the cover of the
book, the relationship between the timing of cherry blossoms and March
temperature in the same year. The data are found in `data(cherry_blossoms)`.
Consider at least two different models (functional relationships) to
predict `doy` with `temp`. Compare them with PSIS or WAIC.

Suppose March temperatures reach 9 degrees by the year 2050. What does your
best model predict for the predictive distribution of the day-in-year that the
cherry trees will blossom?

:::

OK, I feel like I kind of already did this one in the textbook work I've
done, but let's go through it as a fun exercise anyways. First we need to
process the data, which I'll do the same way he did in the book.

```{r}
data("cherry_blossoms")
d <- cherry_blossoms
d2 <- d[complete.cases(d$doy, d$temp), ]

# Also standardize the data
d3 <-
	list(
		doy = standardize(d2$doy),
		temp = standardize(d2$temp)
	)
```

I'll compare the null model, a linear model, a quadratic model, and a
spline-based model similar to the one from the book. I'll just use kind of
random priors on this without a lot of explanation, just fiddling until the
models seems to work correctly. Then I'll compare the models.

```{r}
# Null model (intercept only)
q3_m1 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			doy ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = d3
	)

# Linear model
q3_m2 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			doy ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + b * temp,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			b ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = d3
	)

# Quadratic model
q3_m3 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			doy ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + b1 * temp + b2 * (temp ^ 2),
			a ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			b1 ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			b2 ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = d3
	)

# Power law model
q3_m4 <-
	quap(
		alist(
			doy ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + b * temp,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			b ~ dnorm(0, 3),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = list(
			doy = standardize(log(d2$doy)),
			temp = standardize(log(d2$temp))
		)
	)

# Spline model
# Create the splits
nk <- 15
knot_list <- quantile(d3$temp, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = nk))
B <-
	splines::bs(
		x = d3$temp,
		knots = knot_list[-c(1, nk)],
		degree = 3,
		intercept = TRUE
	)

q3_m5 <-
	quap(
		flist = alist(
			doy ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + B %*% w,
			a ~ dnorm(100, 10),
			w ~ dnorm(0, 10),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = list(doy = d3$doy, B = B),
		start = list(w = rep(0, ncol(B)))
	)
```

All the models fit fine so I assume my randomly guessed priors were OK. First
we'll compare with WAIC.

```{r}
compare(q3_m1, q3_m2, q3_m3, q3_m4, q3_m5)
```

And now with PSIS.

```{r}
compare(
	q3_m1, q3_m2, q3_m3, q3_m4, q3_m5,
	sort = "PSIS",
	func = PSIS
)
```

OK, so both the WAIC the the PSIS comparison give us the same result. The
linear model is actually the best fit, jujst by a hair. If we take the SE
into account, the linear, quadratic, and power law models all seem to fit
pretty decent. The spline model is a bit worse, within one SE, and all
of the "real" models are better than the null model. My guess is that
while the spline model is flexible, it doesn't gain enough predictive power
from this flexibility in order to be "worth" the large number of parameters
needed.

Now let's plot the results to get a better idea of what we're looking at.

```{r}
post <- sim(q3_m2)
out <- colMeans(post * sd(d2$doy) + mean(d2$doy))
plot(
	d2$doy, out,
	xlab = "Actual DoY", ylab = "Predicted DoY"
)

plot(
	d2$year, d2$doy, type = "l"
)
shade(
	apply(post, 2, \(x) rethinking::PI(x* sd(d2$doy) + mean(d2$doy)) ),
	d2$year,
	col = rethinking::col.alpha("gray", alpha = 0.75)
)
lines(d2$year, out, col = "red", lwd = 3)


plot(
	NULL, xlim = range(d2$year), ylim = c(-20, 20)
)
shade(
	apply(post, 2, \(x) rethinking::PI(x  * sd(d2$doy) + mean(d2$doy) - d2$doy)),
	d2$year,
	col = rethinking::col.alpha("gray", alpha = 0.75)
)
lines(d2$year, out - d2$doy, type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 2)
```


Finally, let's look at the distribution of predictions for if we set the
temperature to 9 degrees.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

**4.** The data in `data(Dinosaurs)` are body mass estimates at different
estimated ages for six different dinosaur species. Choose one or more of these
species and make a predictive model of body mass using age as a predictor.
Consider two or more model types for the function relating age to body mass and
score each using PSIS and WAIC.

Which model do you think is best, on predictive grounds? On scientific grounds?
If your answers to these questions differ, why?
